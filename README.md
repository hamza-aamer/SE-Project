This project tries to develop a web-based system that facilitates final year projects (FYP). The whole FYP is a year-long process involving groups of students and their supervisors to accomplish a theme-based project. It is very necessary to employ the latest technologies to allow different parties to contribute and communicate more efficiently. This is a tedious and error-prone task to manually complete the allocation of projects. Therefore, you all must design and develop a comprehensive web-based system to better support the users; like FYP Committee, Project Supervisors, Panel Members, and the Project Group Members (Students). The system will keep all the information of supervisors, group members, panel members, project details and evaluations. Students can share resources about the project including source code and data files using SQL Server repository. The system is designed and developed keeping in view that,
System should be user friendly
The system is also equipped with state of security features, which enables only the authorized people to view or modify the sensitive information
The information is protected by login and password, which can be assigned to each user of the system.
There will be a proper report generation process too. Then at the end, you can analyze the overall report of all projects of the year.
